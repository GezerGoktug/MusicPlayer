# MusicPlayer üéµ

**<p>In this project, I created a music player with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. If we talk about the features of the music player:</p>**
<strong><ul>
  <li>Music play and stop functions</li>
  <li>Next, and go back to the previous music and start playing it automatically</li>
  <li>Fast forward to a desired part of the song from the music bar</li>
  <li>Mute, unmute or adjust the volume to the desired volume from the sound bar</li>
  <li>Open the music list and play the desired music</li>
  <li>Whichever song you stopped at, the remaining song information is saved in localstorage, so when you open it again, you can continue from the song you stopped at.</li>
</ul></strong>


  ## Technologies and Libraries üõ†Ô∏è
